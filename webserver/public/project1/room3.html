    <h1>Living Room</h1>
    <br>
    <p>At first this was just me and my sisters room, until my parents moved to sleep in there too.</p>
    <p>Even though our parents slept in the same room as us, my sister and I always went to sleep without</p>
    <p>them. They'd return home from work after we were asleep and left before we woke up.</p>

    <p>Other than a cabinet, the only pieces of furniture were two large mattresses which we</p>
    <p>slept on. I remember my sister would always set the temperature to something too low and I would</p>
    <p>wake up freezing.</p>
